# This project is a work in progress

The server-side counterpart to [MSNotes_client](https://github.com/mmccorm1ck/MSNotes_client)

A system for integrating the Moleskine Smart system into obsidian

This server accepts .txt files exported by the Moleskine Notes app and uploaded using the client counterpart. It then adds them to that day's daily note in an obsidian vault managed through [obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git)

Built with [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
